If the derivation kind is 'specialization' then this is the master definition for a type, and there is always one of these (a data type, an extension, a resource, including abstract ones). Otherwise the structure definition is a constraint on the stated type (and in this case, the type cannot be an abstract type).  References are URLs that are relative to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition e.g. \"string\" is a reference to http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/string. Absolute URLs are only allowed in logical models, where they are required.",
      "comment" : "Note that in the case of constraints, the type could be determined by chasing through the baseDefinition references until a type defining structure (derivation = specialization) is reached, or by looking at the path of the first element in the snapshot - if present - but providing the type directly makes for simpler tooling and indexing. \n\nThe type must match the elements defined in the differential and the snapshot. For all FHIR defined types, the path name of the element will start with the type name. For logical models, where the type SHALL be a fully specified URL, the type name SHOULD start with the final path segment of the type URL where required. E.g. If the type was \"http://example.org/fhir/MyLogicalModelType\", the type name should start with 'MyLogicalModelType'.",

This is done in [Resource Profiles](profiling.html#mustsupport), where the profile labels an element as mustSupport=true. When a profile does this, it SHALL also make clear exactly what kind of \"support\" is required, as this can mean many things.    Note that an element that has the property IsModifier is not necessarily a \"key\" element (e.g. one of the important elements to make use of the resource), nor is it automatically mustSupport - however both of these things are more likely to be true for IsModifier elements than for other elements.",

Note that servers may pre-cache summarized resources for optimal performance. When a request is made with _summary=true, serializers only include elements marked as 'isSummary = true'. With a few exceptions (listed below), all datatype properties are included in the summary form. In resource and datatype definitions, if an element has a descendant marked as isSummary=true or if it satisfies both of the following conditions, it must be marked as isSummary=true:\n* is at the root or has a parent that is 'mustSupport'\n* has a minimum cardinality of 1 or is a modifier element\n\nThe following datatype properties are exceptions, and are not marked as isSummary:\n* Attachment.data\n* Signature.data, Signature.targetFormat, Signature.sigFormat\n* Narrative.status, Narrative.div\n* SampledData.data.",
